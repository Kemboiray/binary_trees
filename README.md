# binary_trees
The objective of this project is to understand:
  * What is a binary tree
  * What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
  * What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
  * What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
  * What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
  * What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
